### Introduction

Hello, my name is Paul, born in 1984. I am a passionate Software Engineer. In the last years my main technical focus was .NET / ASP.NET, developing web applications and APIs. Part of this were always different databases (including MSSQL, SQLite, Oracle) and front ends (including TypeScript/JavaScript, ASP.NET, WinForms, KnockoutJS).

I don't shy away from any challenge and am looking forward to interesting projects, new technologies and doing great work together.
